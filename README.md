Flight Booker is a one-way flight booking application. 

Allows user to search among a list of flights seeded to the database, choose a flight,
and book a ticket.

Built with Ruby on Rails and styled with CSS. Flight Booker uses Rails Active Record Associations to create relationships between a Flight, Booking, and Passenger model. Rails Validations are present in the booking section to make sure the appropriate fields are filled out before saving the information in the database.
